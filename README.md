## Duck Rescue
Duck Rescue is a project dedicated to learn about visionOS development including SwiftUI, managing App State, RealityKit and the connection between that. It serves as proof of concept for a game that lets the user control a duck through a maze while having to not touch the walls and get away from a mysterious entity that will eliminate the baby duck upon hitting it.
